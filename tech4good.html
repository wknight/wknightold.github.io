 
Tech for Good: Empowering AI Leadership

 
WK:

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Tech for Good: Empowering AI Leadership.


Over the past few years, I’m sure you’ve heard a great deal about artificial intelligence and how it will revolutionize your business or industry, and how it will change every sector of public life from medicine to policing to education.


Indeed, by some estimates, AI has the potential to make organizations 40% more efficient by 2035, unlocking $14 trillion in economic value.


But, of course, with great power comes great responsibility.


As AI is used to make ever-more important decisions, we need to carefully consider how it draws its conclusions and how those conclusions affect real people.

 
This is especially critical if algorithms are going to be used to decide who gets bail, who receives what medical treatment, and how our children are taught.


This isn’t just an academic issue. It is critical for business leaders and politicians.

 
And because AI transcends national borders, nations need to come to some sort of international agreement about what constitutes AI ethics at a time when the world seems increasingly divided.



 

Without further ado, let me introduce our panelists.

Satsuki Katayama, Minister of State for Regional Revitalization of Japan

Chen Liming, Chairman, Greater China Group, IBM Corporation, People's Republic of China

Joanna Bryson, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Bath, United Kingdom

Anand S. Rao, Global Leader, Artificial Intelligence, PwC, USA


 

Questions:


Anand: You help international organizations make use of AI, which is emerging as the defining technology of our age. With many industries already using AI for decision-making, what is the role of the private sector in ensuring AI does not de- stabilize society for capital gains?

Joanna: At a time of vast inequality and political polarization, how important is it for the public to be able to trust AI technology, and if we are not able to trust AI, how can it be governed better for responsible rather than exploitative usage?

Joanna: How important is it that we switch our language away from "AI must be responsible" to "we must be responsible and accountable for the AI we create"?

Chen: IBM has been exploring AI and machine learning for decades. In light of this, what does trustworthy AI mean to IBM?

Minister Katayama: Japan is set to launch its super city, and AI is increasingly become a central focus for Japan's new growth strategy. How can governments use AI responsibly to mitigate potential associated risks?

All:

Facial recognition has recently become very controversial in the US, with San Francisco going so far as to ban the technology.

The backlash over AI ethics has at times been fierce.
